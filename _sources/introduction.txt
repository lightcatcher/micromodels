Introduction
==================

Unstructured data is popular and convenient. Although weak structure may allow a
better representation of data by the producer of the data, it also makes the
data more difficult to consume and process.

Micromodels add convenience and structure to unstructured data.

Micromodels works with Python dictionaries. Convenience functions are
included for the manipulation of JSON, but any other format of data will need to
be manipulated into a dictionary before it can be used with micromodels.
